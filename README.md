# PowerBI
This project focuses on building an interactive Power BI dashboard that provides comprehensive insights into the performance of a call center. The dashboard consolidates and visualizes key metrics such as Total incoming calls, Total call duration, average call duration, average satisfaction rating, calls answered, calls resolved, Total calls by agent, topic. By using Power BI, this project enables real-time tracking and actionable insights to optimize call center operations, improve customer service, and streamline decision-making.
